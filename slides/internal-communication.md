# Internal Communication

## Do:
- âœ… Try using the team channels instead of DMs
- âœ… Bring up blockers in meetings
- âœ… Use PR review/github comments to talk about code

## Why:
- More visibility: someone else might also have the answer to your question ðŸ‘€
- Faster replies: different timezones and schedules so it's better for async collaboration
