# Using Mockups

## Do
- âœ… Follow mockups to match color scheme, font family, layout, etc

## Avoid
- ðŸ›‘ Following mockups to the letter all the time

## Why
- Thereâ€™s a point where attempting to match the mockups exactly comes at a detriment to the codebase, and to the developer experience, or even the app itself.
