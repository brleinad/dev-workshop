# Scope creep

## Do
- ✅ Use atomic commits and keep PRs small
- ✅ Go for the MVP first, edge cases and refactoring can go in another PR
- ✅ Plan out what you're going to code before starting and try to stick to it

## Avoid
- 🛑 Squeezing in features and fixes in PRs or releases
- 🛑 Overengineering things. Usually easier to refactor than to do the best scalable solution from the get go

## Why
- More lines == more 🐛
- ⏳ Deadlines
- Makes PR reviews, debugging bugs and keeping track of tickets easier 🚀
