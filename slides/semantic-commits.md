# [Semantic commits](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

### Do:
- ✅ Use semantic commit messages, emojis help.
- ✅ Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- ✅ Good commit: `🐛 fix edge case with 11 digit zip codes`
- ✅ Explain why the commit does what it does.

## Avoid:
- 🛑 Vague commit messages like `updated the component`

## Why:
- Helps keep commits atomic.
- Easier to understand what a commit did.
